  <h3> 1.1:</h3>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>GPS devices use a network of satellites to retrieve location-based information.</li>
    <li>Every year or two the capacities of computers have approximately doubled inexpensively. This statement is known as Moore's Law.</li>
    <li>A database is an electronic collection of data that's organized for easy access and manipulation.</li>
    <li>Interpreter programs were developed to execute high-level language programs directly without the need for compilation.</li>
    <li>Translator programs called compilers converrt high-level language programs into machine language.</li>
    <li>Alpha versions are often buggy, incomplete and unstable and are released to a relatively small number of developers for testing new features, getting early feedback, etc.</li>
    <li>Computing costs are dropping dramatically, owing to trepaid developments in hardware and sofrware technologies.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3> 1.2:</h3>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>C++ source code filenames often end with the cpp, cxx, cc, or c extensions.</li>
    <li>C++ offers software packages for Microsoft Windows such as Microsoft Visual C++.</li>
    <li>The compiler translates the C++ program into machine-language code--also referred to as object code.</li>
    <li>There is also the standard error stream referred to as cerr.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3> 1.3:</h3>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Objects have the property of information hiding--although objects may know how to communicate with eachother across well-defined interfaces, they normally are not allowed to know how other objects are implemented.</li>
    <li>In C++, a program unit called class is created to house the set of funcations that perform the class's takss--these are know as the class's member functions.</li>
    <li>Programming in languages like C++ is known as object-oriented programming, which allows implementing an object-oriented design as a working system.</li>
    <li>With inheritence, new classes of objects are derived by absorbing characteristics of existing classes, then adding unique characteristics of their own.</li>
    <li>The Unified Modeling Language is a graphical language that allows people who design software systems to use an industry-standard notation to represent them.</li>
    <li>The size, shape, color, and weight of an object are considered properties of the object's class.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3> 1.4:</h3>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Motion and orientation information from an accelerometer and position data from a GPS device are examples of newer forms of records data.</li>
    <li>The computer's character set is the set of all the characters used to write programs and represent data items.</li>
    <li>Assembly language is a type of computer language that uses English-like appreviations for machine-language instructions.</li>
    <li>Output unit is a logical unit of the computer that sends information which has already been processed by the computer to various devices so that it may be used outside the computer.</li>
    <li>The memory unit is a logical unit of the computer that retains processed information until it can be placed on output devices by the output unit.</li>
    <li>ALU is a logical unit of the computer that performs calculations and makes logical decisions.</li>
    <li>The speed of a computer processor can be measured by the number of cycles it performs per second.</li>
    <li>High-level languages are most convenient to the programmer for writing programs quickly and easily.</li>
    <li>The only language a computer can directly understand is that computer's machine language.</li>
    <li>CPU is a logical unit of the computer that coordinates the activities of all the other logical units.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3> 1.5:</h3>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Searches are used to match specific character patterns in text.</li>
    <li>C++14 added several language features and C++ Standard Library enhancements, and fixed bugs from C++11.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3> 1.6:</h3>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>Software product release categories are alpha, beta, release-candidate, and release.</li>
    <li>Cloud computing provides a computing platform for developing and runnin applications as a service over the web, rather than installing the tools on your computer.</li>
